\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Software Engineer with a broad experience 
in software development, machine learning and data analytics. I have 
worked on projects ranging from real-time embedded systems to geospatial ML on AWS.
I code in modern C++ (11/14/17) and Python. I have a background in scientific computation and
I hold a PhD in experimental particle physics.

I am passionate about machine perception applications (especially vision) and have
built on my background in scientific computation by developing skills 
in computer vision (OpenCV), robotic software (ROS), numerical python (numpy/pandas/scipy/matplotlib), machine learning (scikit-learn), deep learning (TensorFlow),
and data engineering (Apache Beam, TensorFlow TFX, AWS).

I hold a C permit, 
speak german, have been resident in Switzerland for 20 years.
I am married to a Swiss national.

\lettersection{Why You?}
Your position would successfuly combine my experience in embedded software engineering
(C++), algorithm development (Python) and skills in computer vision (C++/Python) to 
work on an innovative product with a true societal value. It would be satisfying to 
bring several career threads together in a domain that I am passionate about and
in a product that really can change the world.


\lettersection{Why Me?}

As an experienced software engineer I have strong skills in 
Design Patterns, SOLID, TDD, CI/CD, Clean Code and Test Automation.
I have developed Java REST analytic backend services, I 
have developed efficient C++ for embedded devices and
I am enthusiastic about high-performance computing and using 
techniques like cache optimized memory management 
and vectorization (SIMD).

I have experience of computer vision and robotics using OpenCV, ROS and Eigen to detect, match and track 
visual features for stereo visual odometry. 
I have optimized TensorFlow neural networks for GPUs
to run object detection in realtime (40FPS) on embedded devices and developed
CNN classifiers for histopathologic cancer detection.
As a PhD particle physicist I have an understanding of the mathematical foundations of 
computer vision 
(e.g. linear algebra, multivariate calculus, statistics, probability theory).

As a data scientist I bring experience in developing machine learning 
models (scikit-learn and tensorflow) and setting up data analytic pipelines in python and Java 
for a SmartMobility SaaS platform running on AWS and consuming remote sensor data. 
I also productionized and deployed the models as REST endpoints and developed serverless datat 
injestion pipelines.
