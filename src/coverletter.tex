\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a Senior Software Engineer (15 years) and Data Scientist (2 years) with a broad experience 
in software development and data analytics.
I code in modern C++ (11/14/17), Python, Java
and Scala. I have a background in scientific computation and
I hold a PhD in experimental particle physics. I was a research scientist 
on the LHC at CERN (8 years).

I am passionate about data analytics and scientific computing and have
built on my background in scientific data analysis by developing skills 
in numerical python (numpy/pandas/scipy/matplotlib), machine learning (scikit-learn, H2O), deep learning (TensorFlow),
and data engineering (Apache Beam, TensorFlow TFX, AWS) over a five year period.

I hold a C permit, 
speak german, have been resident in Switzerland for 20 years.
I am married to a Swiss national.

\lettersection{Why You?}
Xovis offers a unique opportunity to combine data analytic skills gained working as 
a Data Scientist, the programming skills (from embedded to cloud) gained as 
a senior software engineer, and recent computer vision skills to develop 
a cool product based on cutting edge technology. It would be personally satisfying 
to hold the position and bring together several career threads. 


\lettersection{Why Me?}

As an experienced software engineer I have strong skills in 
Design Patterns, SOLID, TDD, CI/CD, Clean Code and Test Automation.
I have developed Java REST analytic backend services, I 
have developed efficient C++ for embedded devices and
I am enthusiastic about high-performance computing and using 
techniques like cache optimized memory management 
and vectorization (SIMD).

As a data scientist I bring experience in developing machine learning 
models (scikit-learn and tensorflow) and setting up data analytic pipelines in python and Java 
for a SmartMobility SaaS platform running on AWS and consuming remote sensor data. 
I also productionized and deployed the models as REST endpoints and developed serverless datat 
injestion pipelines.


I have experience of computer vision using OpenCV to detect, match and track 
visual features in real-time for stereo visual odometry. 
I have optimized TensorFlow neural networks 
to run object detection in realtime (40FPS) on embedded devices and developed
CNN classifiers for histopathologic cancer detection.
As a PhD experimental particle physicist I have a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of 
computer vision, machine learning and state estimation 
(e.g. linear algebra, multivariate calculus, statistics, probability theory).
