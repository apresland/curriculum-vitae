Developer of data intensive applications with low-latency and real-time 
requirements in Python, C++, and Java. Architect of scalable inferencing 
systems for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, employing edge-to-cloud 
design with data synchronization with the Cloud. Builder of ML models and pipelines for training, evaluating ML models with focus 
on time-series sensor data. Data Science and data visualization.

I started my career in Experimental Particle Physics, obtaining a PhD in at CERN, 
developing particle detectors based on photon and electron measurement, 
developing the physics event data models and performing event reconstruction 
with statistical and probabalistic models. I was CERN Research Fellow for Applied Physics working 
on Monte Carlo simulation for the LHC.

Key interests: Data systems engineering, sensing, machine learning, state-estimation, 
high performance computing.
