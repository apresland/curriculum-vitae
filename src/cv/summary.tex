Focused on perception, localization and autonomous systems I am a Machine Learning 
Engineer and Data Scientist skilled in scientific Python, modern C++ for data 
intensive applications and data engineering. I have written code for particle physics 
experiments at the LHC, written high performance software for embedded systems and 
developed machine learning models and engineered data for SmartMobility. Starting my 
career in experimental particle physics (PhD) at CERN I acquired experience 
in sensor fusion, reconstruction, simulation, scientific programming and High 
Performance Computing and recently I have been active as a Data Scientist in 
SmartMobility using remote sensing data (GPS/IMU) to detect human mobility
patterns. Previously I worked as an Embedded Systems software engineer developing
for constrained systems running RTOS and embedded Linux (motion control, IoT).

Key interests: intelligent systems, machine perception, state-estimation, 
high performance computing and data systems engineering.
