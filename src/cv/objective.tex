1. Contribute to the delivery of innovative sensing based analytics products by 
exploiting a broad experience in software engineering, data science and 
scientific computing. I will achieve this by leverage polyglot programming skills 
in C++(11/14/17) and Python, combined with AI/ML experienced gained working as a data 
scientist. Leverage the
sensor development, data analysis and numerical computing skills gained working as a particle physicist 
working on experiments at the LHC.

2. Join a team that will benefit from my passion for software engineering, 
machine learning and computer vision. I will contribute knowledge acquired completing training
in AI (e.g. Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Robot Perception) and experience of
technologies like TensorFlow, TensorRT, OpenCV and CUDA acquired developing projects 
that GPU accelerate neural networks for real-time object detection on 
embedded systems (Jetson Nano) and to implement stereo visual odometry.
