Contribute to the delivery of innovative sensing data based analytics products 
by exploiting a broad experience in software engineering, data science and 
scientific computing.
I will achieve this by leverage polyglot engineering skills in Python, C++, Scala, 
and Java, combined with skills gained working as a data scientist for a SmartMobility SaaS platform
and a general aptitude for data analysis and scientific computing demonstrated by my 
time as a particle physicist working on experiments at the LHC.

I want to use my passion for artificial intelligence, scientific 
computing and special interest in computer vision and the skills I 
aligned with the needs of todays 
innovative products by completing specialisms in data facing technologies 
(e.g. Data Science in Python, Functional Programming in Scala, Deep Learning)
and a recently completed a sabbatical year dedicating over 500 hours to certifications 
focused on Computer Vision, TensorFlow and Robotic Perception and to developing 
projects
that GPU accelerate object detection neural networks on embedded systems 
and perform visual SLAM using OpenCV.
